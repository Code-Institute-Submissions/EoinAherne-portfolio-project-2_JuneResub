# portfolio-project-2
A rock, paper, scissors game. Created using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript. I aimed to create a dynamic and responsive front end web application 
that takes input from the user, creates a randomised computer choice, compares them together and determines a winner. 
This application will have the ability to keep player scores, displaying them on a scoreboard. 
Display a message telling who wins each round after the round is played, 
also giving the option reset the game if the user wishes
